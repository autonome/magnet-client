  <title>Mozfest 2016 - Digital Making Space-Hacker!</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Mozfest 2016 - "In a real-life implementation of the Design Probe research method of Fiona Raby and Anthony Dunne, this artwork is a hands-on creative intervention that asks users to contribute directly and collaboratively as designers and thinkers. Exploring spatial imaginaries and digital making, it comes to life through on-site creations during the MozEx experience, evolving both digitally and physically.
It first exists as a hands-on “creation station”, an inviting space filled with colourful creative materials to use, from magazines to photographs, storybooks to markers. Participants are invited to answer two questions: (1) Think of a community you are a part of. Sketch them here. (2) If you could design a space for digital making* they feel comfortable using, what would it look like? What objects would it include?
The artwork then comes to life online through an evolving curatorial webpage that displays participant submissions publicly, their contents easily shared, viewed and remixed.">
