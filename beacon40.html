Examples include everything from a cosmic ray detector to measure cloud coverage to a sensor belt for helping blind people navigate. People will have a chance to learn how the technology behind each project works, and make their own prototype. The projects will be selected from the CERN Webfest - an annual Open Science hackathon launched five years ago by Citizen Cyberlab and currently  organized by CERN openlab with the support of the Mozilla Science Lab.">
