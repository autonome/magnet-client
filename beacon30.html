  <title>Mozfest 2016 - How hard could it be?  Building the Research &
Education Space

</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Mozfest 2016 - The Research & Education Space (RES) programme is an initiative to bring the nation’s public archives to education across the UK, from primary to University level using Linked Open Data.

Sounds easy, right? Especially when you’re the BBC, Jisc and Learning on Screen.
Come and find out why we’ve been building the Research & Education Space, why it’s not that easy after all, where our three years of work has got us to, and how you can get involved.
The session will provide an opportunity for developers, collection-holders, teachers, academics and students to see what we’ve done—including how to use our API, ask us questions and give us their suggestions on how to improve it.
