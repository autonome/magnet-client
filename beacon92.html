  <meta name="description" content="Mozfest 2016 - "In the piece I experiment with embodiment of cognition. I work with EEG data, creating a metaphorical journey into human’s mind and personality. I refer to Hayles’s posthumanism scenarios on the fate of embodiment in an information age and the cultural and technological construction of the cyborg, which imagines a triumphant transcendence of embodiment and 'privileges informational pattern over material instantiation' (Hayles, 1999).
I further these ideas translating the recording of electrical activity along the scalp into a sculptural responsive surface, that reacts to a change of a human’s brain activity – you perform and transmit your own data live. The work uncovers the themes of mixed reality and augmentation relating to the body."">
