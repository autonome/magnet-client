  <title>Mozfest 2016 - Pardon the dust (09/03/2016, 13:44-13:47)</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Mozfest 2016 - When a tweet is deleted, it leaves behind a eighteen digit code, an imprint of a thought or feeling. That number could be considered a sequencer, a data string which when fed through an algorithm becomes a soundscape.
Captured from the live twitter stream, the audible output is dictated by what is being removed from the internet at that very moment in time to produce a very public creation of something intended to be obscured, undertaking a process of creation from the act of deletion, a process of revealing through the act of concealment as it algorithmically creates an almost musical score from digital debris.
As the machine plays back its composition at a low frequency, the audio can be felt as well as heard, reconfiguring the normally latent digital stream into an unescapable presence.">
