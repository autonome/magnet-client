We can't easily change the shape of our faces, and the subtle nuances in the way we type, touch, and swipe. Although some of these are learnt behaviours, the rapid reduction in the cost of computation has allowed sophisticated fingerprinting techniques to adapt as we change as individuals.
Are we fighting against the inevitable? With each and every interaction we give away a few bits of information about us. It only takes a few bits to make a link and break our pseudonymity.
You Look Familiar uses facial recognition to create art and generate metadata. Every interaction changes what is visible on the screen. The observer is given a unique pseudonym that is shown at each interaction point along with the metadata.
