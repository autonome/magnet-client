  <title>Mozfest 2016 - Earth</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Mozfest 2016 - The project uses cutting edge Hubble / NASA images that are found using the web. These images are printed using the nineteenth century technique of photogravure.
My PhD research at the Royal College of Art is focused on how astronomical images are presented to the general public. Raw data is often edited by astronomers for general consumption without explanation. This project comments on the mediation of an image by astronomers, and considers how artists can reverse this process. How does the NASA/web image change when it is printed with alternative photography processes.
I would like to curate a London Alternative Photography Collective talk alongside artist Almudena Romero, to discover how other artists use the web and new technologies in conjunction with antiquated processes.">
