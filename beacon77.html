From those it creates a new illustration. Learning day by day from your favourites! Creating our perfect ice cream.   The program uses a parameterised circle, rectangle and triangle. It learns and evolves their placement, size, rotation and color by using a genetic algorithm. Using basic shapes helps us study the relationship between the ice cream’s components: cone, scoop and chocolate flake. I’m interested in knowing how an ice cream makes you feel. What are its dynamics? How do colours and shapes form an ice cream?">
