  <title>Mozfest 2016 - The Thinkasprint: the art of thinking sideways</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Mozfest 2016 - In this session participants will be taken through a modified version of We Are Open Co-op's 'thinkathon' approach, to help people think about knotty problems in an open, inclusive, and participatory way. The process involves as much drawing as it does thinking and writing, and is solution-oriented.

We use the wealth of experience that participants and facilitators have to take apart a problem and look at it from a different angle. We will go off at tangents and down rabbit holes, but that's all part of the process!

Our starting point will be whatever issues participants bring to the table after our icebreaker activity, but we have a few ideas up our sleeves, such as Open Badges for employability, digital skills, and 'passion projects'.">
