  <title>Mozfest 2016 - Autonomous Network Architecture: the discussions</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Mozfest 2016 - In art and technology panel discussions are common. In these panels critics, experts and other relevant parties discuss their ideas and levy their reputations. Three light-sculptures in Autonomous Network Architecture show 3 chatbots who play the role of an artists/hacker (autonomy), the telco (network) and the architect/engineer (architecture). On the 3 light-sculptures the bots discuss the need for an autonomous network architecture, in which each bot focuses on their own specialty. The connection between the panels (bots) goes via a self developed open source autonomous communication network that uses Bluetooth Low Energy as infrastructure.
Each bot reacts on each other via a custom build library. These reactions create an ever-changing script about the topics. These scripts imitate the unstable constellation of the current communication infrastructure. More and more of the data that runs through communication networks is automatically generated data (internet of things). Machines talking to machines. This installation recreates this on a small scale discussing current and important topics about dependencies on the current mass communication structures.">
