  <title>Mozfest 2016 - #emptyweb</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Mozfest 2016 - #emptyweb is an ongoing project in which I am collecting screenshots on my phone of web pages before the content has loaded. I find the simple graphic geometric blocks of colour are far more appealing to me than the often frivolous content they are designed to contain. My first child was born in 2013 and I was frequently looking at my phone at night while I tried to soothe my son back to sleep. My poor internet connection at home meant that web pages often took a long time to load and I became fascinated by the graphic structures that appeared before the content of a web page. I started to see it as a challenge to capture the #emptywebs before the content loaded and I released the similarity with this an conventional photography which often seeks to capture fleeting moments of beauty.">
