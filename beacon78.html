  <title>Mozfest 2016 - Ichographs MdelP</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Mozfest 2016 - Ichographs MdelP (Madonna del Prato) is a sound and picture artwork that explores the relationships between colors and frequencies. The famous painting of Raffaello is decomposed into 10,0000 cubic particles each carrying a frequency relevant to its color. As we move around, we hear the sound of all these colors/frequency generator particles fly in the space towards the canvas to compose the painting.
Ichographs is a method of creating soundscapes using visual stimulus and the color-frequency transformation. The painting is transformed into the audio domain and back to visual producing a contemporary amalgamation. As we pass through the various color/frequency layers, we investigate the connections between classical aesthetics and the digital practice, revealing a latent version of the old masterpiece. The final artwork is a contemporary amalgamation of the old painting and the modern abstraction methods, a harmonious dialog between the old and the new, the analog and the digital.">
