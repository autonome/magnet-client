  <title>Mozfest 2016 - Alerts in Flesh</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Mozfest 2016 - - 5 performers will stand in 5 places around the conference venue/or in the city.
- Each performer will be reading out loud live tweets from her phone with a certain hashtag that is somehow related to the event or its topics.
- Between the tweets or when there are pictures, a simple musical instrument will play a note. (Shaker, triangle, etc.)
- The spots can be some of these: courtyard, main hall, bathrooms, tube station, public square, a cafe/bar/restaurant nearby.
- Hashtags can be: #mozfest16 #web #london #brexit #hillary #trump #kabul #baghdad #refugees #berlin #trending #breakingnews #poem #hyperlink
What we need for it to happen is:
1. 10-15 theatre actors with powerful voices (one freestyle rapper among them for the cafe)
2. One simple musical instrument for each
3. One mobile phone for each
4. 10-15 tshirts with the intended hashtag on it">
