  <title>Mozfest 2016 - Monotone</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Mozfest 2016 - Monotone reproduces the genesis of life as an organic character through fractal transformations emanating from random behaviour. The algorithmic work is made up of hundreds of thousands of fragile fractal texels in an iterated function system. The perceptible motion of the particles is similar to biomorphic and synthetic biological forms that connect to an unknown original universal matter and its procedural inception. They slowly and gently draw mesmerizing figures, according to stochastic rules. The result, hypnotic and mind-bending, is a brilliant example of the aesthetics of code. The sound composition uses digital signal processing to create shamanic rhythms of high intensity. The interconnected cells resemble processes in nature, from the origin of light to the creation of matter, in an unpredictable way, due to accidental movement. The work connects biology, maths and arts imitating universal shapes of life in morphogenic and creative processes.">
