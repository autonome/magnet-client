Mozart (260th year this year) devised a clever game in the 18th century by throwing dice to make apparently “random” choices from a grid of musical examples. Thus an appropriate example is always selected. Whether or not the dice player understands to the process, s/he will always produce a coherent piece. Using a coded process the “player” can create a piece with even less prior musical knowledge.

The digital form of the game allows the participant much more flexibility to examine patterns as between music and coding. With a minimum of formal musical knowledge, the participant can gain insights into patterns and how they work.">
