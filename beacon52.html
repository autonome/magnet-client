Corn begins at the top of the third floor as multicolored (dyed) kernels that enter a funnel. The funnel leads through ductwork to the second floor and appears to enter one of three TVs, which play random video footage tinted in red, green, or blue. Tubing connects the three TVs to a fourth TV on the second floor, which plays full-color streamed footage and social media posts from the Mozfest event. Popcorn drops from the first floor to the ground floor through a tapered clear-plastic hopper, ending at a table with a regular-sized popcorn tub that fills with popcorn.">
