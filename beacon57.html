social media electoral campaign to build a digital wall, a nod towards his proposed construction along the Mexico/US border.
The piece collects and converts images posted to social media in support of Trump, averaging each image's colour and placing a digital brick of this colour to a screen until the screen is full, whereby the resulting image is then uploaded to Twitter with hashtags used most often by Trump. The screen is then cleared and the process repeated. Each following full screen is uploaded along with all proceeding images in a batch, increasingly leaving an imprint on the Trump campaign.
The algorithm incorporates increasingly more versions of itself into its creations, essentially 'eating itself'.">
