  <title>Mozfest 2016 - Are You Clean? Real-time Technologies and Identity, Property and Privacy.</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Mozfest 2016 - The internet was, at least initially, associated with a democratizing effect through providing “immediate access to and transparency of data” by reason of the virtual and distributed networks it has made possible.1 Many now regard that promise to have been undermined by commercialisation. Corporations have asserted intellectual property rights that considered to be inconsistent with a cultural environment in which the reconfiguration of both identities and objects is possible by reason of online digital technologies. This paper explores various areas of TM ClubCard as an example of intersection of commerce, law and technology for privacy and property.">
