  <title>Mozfest 2016 - Abstract Playground</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Mozfest 2016 - Abstract Playground is a screen-based interactive designed alongside people with Learning Difficulties during a 5 week D-LAB / LEVEL Residency at the LEVEL Centre, Derbyshire. It presents users with a screen displaying a brightly coloured, abstract composition of geometric forms derived from details of Modernist buildings, and a physical custom-made controller. When users press buttons on the controller parts of the composition animate and play sounds, encouraging users to interact with the piece. Each animation and sound has a random element so pressing the same button over and over creates a slightly different result each time, promoting engagement over a long period of time. A second controller with larger buttons is available for people with less refined motor skills, allowing for the work to be used by a wide variety of users.">
