  <title>Mozfest 2016 - Getting it right: Automating Fact Checking and Data Searches in South America and Africa</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Mozfest 2016 - Joint session, with representatives from international journalism organizations Chequeado and Africa Check.

We plan to tell the experience from “Chequeado” in alliance with Full fact, a tool that automatize the process of check the data in media outlets write in English or Spanish. For this we are developing tools that allow find automatically phrases in different media(online, TV, radio, and official publications). Both in this stage like in the next (data search, data qualification and data check) we use technology based on natural language analysis. 

AfricaCheck.org is the continent's leading fact-checking website. Based in South Africa, our team of journalists and researchers spend hours working with data sources to prepare reports. They are also now regularly contacted by journalists asking for help in finding "reliable" data on a wide range of topics. We built a simple tool, on our site, to set out data sources we think useful (not always reliable) and explain pros & cons, but want to share ideas - with both journalists/researchers and UX specialists - about how best to develop this to meet journalists needs.">
