  <title>Mozfest 2016 - dissipate</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Mozfest 2016 - Dissipate is a series of work that explores a long-distance technology dependent relationship I was once in. My ex-boyfriend broke up with me over a WhatsApp conversation – given the circumstances, breaking up in person would have been impossible, and so it happened over a cyberspace of floating words instead. From a very normal honeymoon phase to a very wretched constantly arguing phase to a very dramatic end; the relationship went through many phases in the span of nine months, a journey that is portrayed in my book. There were many moments through the wretched phase though, where there was a constant anticipation on my end. I was always waiting for a reply and when it would come it would be long and sometimes short, heart-breaking words, leaving me with a kind of “bam!" Similar to the anticipation of when heating something up in the microwave, I was constantly in anticipation waiting for a reply, and when I heard back it was gut-wrenching words that broke my heart. I put Polaroids I photographed in the microwave, but what I photographed did not matter, it was what happened to the Polaroid once popped into the microwave that did. Burnt and damaged they resembled me through the wretched phase of my relationship. Everything through this time felt surreal; technology really gives people a means to disappear and this series of work is my memento of that.">
