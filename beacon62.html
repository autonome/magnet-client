  <title>Mozfest 2016 - Forbidden Fruit Machine</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Mozfest 2016 - "The “Forbidden Fruit Machine” is an interactive installation, which is based on Creative Commons licensed and public domain images and sounds found on the Web. The installation turns essentially a 16th century painting from the Dutch Rijksmuseum into a mechatronic video game. The painting depicts Eve and Adam in the Garden of Eden, being tempted by the serpent to eat the forbidden fruit. With a joystick and 3D printed plotter mechanism the spectator can take over the destiny of the apple and discover special effects hidden in the picture.
The installation promotes the exploration of open cultural online collections for artistic purposes beyond the screen. Open hardware is also embraced, as we have shared the documentation of the installation including 3D printing and Arduino files under an open license for anyone to build upon. "">
